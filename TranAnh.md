# Introduction
Hey there! I'm Tran Anh, just graduated from Vassa University of Applied Sciences, and I'm all about coding! I'm a self-taught full-stack developer from Finland, and I love turning cool ideas into reality with sleek interfaces. Making software is my passion, and I'm super into creating projects that not only look good but also have awesome architecture and top-notch code quality. I'm always excited to learn new stuff and can't wait to bring all my knowledge to the next project! ðŸš€
